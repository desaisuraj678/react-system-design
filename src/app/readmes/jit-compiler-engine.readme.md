- Precompiled Binaries on iOS by Default
React Native 0.84 now ships precompiled binaries on iOS by default. Previously introduced as an opt-in, precompiled binaries are now enabled out of the box, significantly reducing build times for iOS apps.

This means you no longer need to compile React Native core from source every time you do a clean build. The precompiled .xcframework binaries are automatically downloaded and used during pod install
