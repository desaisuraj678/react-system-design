# Redux

 Use case:
  - For organizing global state outside of react component


## Key Points
- Redux expects you update the state immutably

Benifits
1. Seperation of concerns 
2. to know when/where/how the state of the application is updated.
3. Avoiding prop drilling problem (Context tries to solve the same problem)
