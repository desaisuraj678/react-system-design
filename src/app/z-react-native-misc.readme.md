1. Q. fetch() api lifecycle in react.
- When you call fetch() in your React Native app, you're using a JavaScript API that is part of the Web Standards and is polyfilled in React Native.
- The fetch() function is implemented in JavaScript but delegates the actual network request to the native side via the React Native bridge.
- When fetch() is called, the request details (URL, method, headers, body, etc.) are serialized into a message and sent across the bridge to the native side
- On the native side, React Native uses platform-specific networking libraries:
    iOS: NSURLSession (or URLSession in Swift) is used to handle the network request.
    Android: OkHttp (a popular HTTP client library) is used by default in React Native.

    These libraries handle the actual network operations:
        DNS resolution.
        Establishing a connection (TCP/TLS handshake).
        Sending the HTTP request.
        Receiving the HTTP response (status code, headers, and body)
- Once the native networking library receives the response, it is passed back to the JavaScript layer via the React Native bridge.
- The response is deserialized into a JavaScript Response object

Note: Even if we write own native module to replicate fetch(''), we still need to pass request data to native, so instead using react native's fetch() would be performant.
